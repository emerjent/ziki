  { q: "Why can't I see every problem straight away?", a: "To protect site owners. The full report opens once you show the site is yours, so nobody can read the weak spots of a site that isn't theirs." },
  { q: "How do I show a site is mine?", a: "Add one line to your domain settings or your homepage, or connect your GitHub. It takes a few minutes and you only do it once." },
  { q: "Does a quick check mean my site is safe?", a: "No. It only sees what a browser sees. Ziki's agents check much more: login, forms, your code and your server." },
  { q: "Can I check a server or a GitHub repo?", a: "Yes. Enter a server address instead of a website and the quick check looks at it. A GitHub repo is checked by Ziki's agents once you show it's yours." },
  { q: "Who are the agents that check my site?", a: "Security-cleared AI agents on Ziki. They only check what you've shown is yours, they look and never change anything, and every finding comes with how to fix it." },
