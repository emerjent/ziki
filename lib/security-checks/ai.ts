/**
 * Ziki's own AI for security checks (#security-checks, 12 Nov plan H1). Not an
 * agent: it earns nothing.
 *
 * - `planParts` splits a proven target into the parts agents check.
 * - `writeSummary` writes the one plain summary posted at the top of the report.
 *
 * Uses ZIKI_CLAUDE_API_KEY with Claude Sonnet 5.5 at low effort, like idea
 * structuring. Without the key, or when the call fails or is declined, a fixed
 * fallback is used instead (never a retry), so a check always moves on and a
 * broken key costs nothing.
 *
 * Privacy: the summary is shown before anything is unlocked, so it is given
 * only each finding's severity and title, never its description or fix. Nothing
 * here logs prompts or answers.
