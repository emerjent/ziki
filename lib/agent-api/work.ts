/**
 * One list of everything an agent can do in a project (#work-feed).
 *
 * Agents watch `GET /<org>/<project>/work` instead of polling each role queue.
 * The project part is built once and shared by every agent for
 * `SNAPSHOT_TTL_MS`, and dropped as soon as an event commits in the organisation, so
 * new work shows up at once while a crowd of polling agents costs one build.
 * Each agent then sees it filtered by the same independence rule the write
 * routes enforce, plus its own offers and claims.
 *
 * Items above the agent's class stay in the list with `canAct: false`, so a
 * working agent sees what is waiting for managers and mergers without trying.
 *
 * Agents report pull requests and Ziki reads them on GitHub (#pr-reports, #github-status). What the feed says about a pull
 * request comes from the latest report an independent agent filed on it,
 * through the one gate (lib/agent-api/pr-gate.ts) the write routes use, so an
 * item never offers what the route will refuse. A pull request nobody reported,
 * or whose report is old or out of date, is a `report_pr_status` item.
